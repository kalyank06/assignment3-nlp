    "Before move towards understanding the NN used for NLP, let's briefly refresh our understanding of Machine Learning, or shallow learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several fundamental steps to any Machine Learning algorithm. Typically, they follow these steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![basic ML](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1cNhv3qDj_j8Mvga274azmRYJ0LzC2bxx)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common use cases is classification of data. We use a supervised machine learning model where some body of text are classified or labeled. may create an input vector that we must use feature engineering techniques as an input to the ML algorithm. This often means altering the data and making assumptions about the variables in the data that we believe are most pertinent to the predictability of the data. An example is the Naive Bayes and Bag-of-Words representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a model -- for example, training a logistic regression model to determine whether or not a movie review is positive or negative, for example-- we split the labeled data into a training and test sets. First, we will run the algorithm on the training test data, and then evaluate its efficacy. Then, we run the test dataset through the model to evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we evaluate the performance of the model, we tune \"hyperparameters\". Hyperparameters are inputs to our model that have an influence on the models' performance. They are most often inputs by humans and determined through a series of heuristics and they result in estimates to the model parametters. For example, the percentage of data split between a training and test set is a heuristic -- or rule of thumb-- where we often choose 80% of the labeled data to train our model, and 20% to test it.\n",

    "#### 3.1.1 Example: ML Approach with NLP - Sentiment Analysis Using Bag-of-Words\n",
    "We often call the Naïve Bayes classifier the bag-of-words approach. That’s because we are essentially throwing in the collection of words into a ‘bag’, selecting a word at random, and then calculating their frequency to use in the Bayesian Inference. Thus, context – the position of words -- is ignored and despite this, it turns out that the Naïve Bayes approach can be accurate and effective at determining whether an email is spam for example.\n"
